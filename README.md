This game is, so far, a prototype of an idea I had regarding the lasso mechanic.

Controls:
WASD - move
Shoot - Left-Mouse
R - reload
Space - Lasso/Ability
C - Cancel Ability
Shift - Dodge
E - Interact / Pickup
Q - Drop Weapon

Enemies will drop ammunition and life orbs ocassionally. However, if they are killed via the lasso (by lasso'ing the enemies into a wall), they will ALWAYS drop both a life orb and ammo. They will spawn a randomised amount of enemies everytime you load it.

This is nowhere near a complete game, but I do think it will be fun when I add more elements to it.
